      Hey there, I'm Oliver Ohrt,a sophomore at UW-Madison pursuing a Bachelor
      of Science in Computer Science. With a passion for coding and a strong
      foundation in languages like Java, Python, and Rust, I've led multiple
      projects that showcase my problem-solving skills and leadership abilities.
      I've won three hackathons, most recently for developing Badger+, an
      application tailored for UW Madison students. My experience ranges from
      crafting innovative web applications to guiding students as a Robotics
      Instructor at iD Tech Camps. I'm looking to bring my technical expertise
      and collaborative spirit to a dynamic internship where I can continue to
      grow and make an impact.
