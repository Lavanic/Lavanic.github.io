            I had the pleasure of working with Oliver at iD Tech Camps, where he
            excelled as a Robotics Instructor. Oliver taught classes to students
            aged 10-17, and his impact was truly remarkable. He has a natural
            ability to connect with young learners, breaking down complex
            concepts into engaging and accessible lessons. Oliver's passion for
            coding and robotics was evident in every class he led. He created a
            positive and supportive environment that inspired students to
            explore, create, and problem-solve. His dedication to fostering
            curiosity and innovation in his students was impressive, and he
            consistently went above and beyond to ensure they had a meaningful
            learning experience. Oliver's blend of technical expertise, coding,
            creativity, and teaching skill made him an invaluable part of our
            team. Any organization would be fortunate to have him on board.

            Oliver is a bright, kind, clear, customer-focused mind with a keen
            opinion on customer-facing UX and UI design. He was a joy to work
            with during a startup UX study. I especially enjoyed his innovative
            suggestions on future features and their relative priorities. I
            highly recommend him for any technical or business position and hope
            to see him at Microsoft one day.
