            "I had the pleasure of working with
            <span class="red-text">Oliver</span> at
            <span class="green-text">iD Tech Camps</span>, where he excelled as
            a <span class="blue-text">Robotics Instructor</span>.
            <span class="red-text">Oliver</span> taught classes to students aged
            10-17, and his impact was truly remarkable. He has a natural ability
            to connect with young learners, breaking down complex concepts into
            engaging and accessible lessons.
            <span class="red-text">Oliver's</span> passion for
            <span class="yellow-text">coding</span> and
            <span class="blue-text">robotics</span> was evident in every class
            he led. He created a positive and supportive environment that
            inspired students to explore, create, and problem-solve. His
            dedication to fostering curiosity and innovation in his students was
            impressive, and he consistently went above and beyond to ensure they
            had a meaningful learning experience.
            <span class="red-text">Oliver's</span> blend of technical expertise,
            <span class="yellow-text">coding</span>, creativity, and teaching
            skill made him an invaluable part of our team. Any organization
            would be fortunate to have him on board."
