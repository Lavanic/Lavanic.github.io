      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Oliver, a sophomore at UW Madison studying Computer Science.
        I'm passionate about combining leadership and technology to create
        innovative solutions.

        This past summer, I had the incredible opportunity to teach robotics to
        kids aged 7-17. It was an amazing experience that reinforced my belief
        in the power of technology education.
